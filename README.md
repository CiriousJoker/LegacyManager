# Legacy Manager
This is a mod manager for Super Smash Bros. Brawl Legacy XP.
Its purpose os to be a one-click installer/launcher for everything SmashBrosLegacy related.

## Installation
If you just want a working version and do not want to tamper with any source code, just download the official client from this link (link coming soon).

## Current features
- User can set: Brawl.iso location, installation folder and the password
- Buttons:
    - [Install/Update]: Automatically downloads the mod files and builds the game
    - [Remove] automatically removes the game (but not the Legacy Manager)
    - [Play] Launch the game
- Automatically updates itself (updates will be applied on exit)
- Automatically checks for Legacy XP updates during launch and prompts the user to update

## Current limitations
- Updating Legacy XP will completely overwrite the previous installation
- Only works for the dev builds of Legacy XP (and therefore requires a password)

## Future improvements
- Split the game file to shrink update size and to not overwrite all previous settings
- Better error handling
- Linux/Mac support (this will take a while)

## Feature requests
There are already many features planned, but if you have an interesting idea or just a feature you'd like to see implemented, just send me an [e-mail](mailto:ciriousjoker@gmail.com) or open up an issue.
